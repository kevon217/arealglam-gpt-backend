# Project Overview:

This project involves developing a Python backend application integrated with OpenAI's GPT assistants, primarily for a fashion recommendation platform. The system, built using FastAPI, is designed to interact with a React/Next.js frontend. The core functionality revolves around handling user queries about fashion, with the backend orchestrating responses from multiple GPT assistants.

# Project Design/Architecture:

- Backend Framework: FastAPI, supporting asynchronous operations with AsyncIO.
- GPT Assistants: Utilizes three custom OpenAI GPT assistants (Orchestrator, Psychologist, and Wardrobe) to process queries.
- WebSocket Communication: Implemented for real-time interaction between backend and frontend.
- Docker Deployment: Containerization of the backend for deployment, ensuring environment consistency.
- Testing: Integration testing with AsyncIO to verify assistant responses and inter-assistant communication.

# What We've Done?

1. Developed Core Backend Logic: Created services and endpoints in FastAPI to interact with GPT assistants.
2. AsyncThread Implementation: Built an AsyncThread class to manage communication with OpenAI assistants, handling threads, messages, and runs.
3. WebSocket Setup: Established WebSocket logic for real-time data transmission to the frontend.
4. Integration Testing: Conducted tests to ensure proper message passing and response retrieval from OpenAI assistants.
5. Environment Setup: Configured environment variables and OpenAI client for API interactions.
6. Dockerization Prep: Began preparations for Docker deployment.

# What Remains?

7. Frontend Integration: Coordination with the frontend developer for seamless integration, focusing on request handling and WebSocket communication.
8. Testing in Docker Environment: Testing the complete system within a Docker container to ensure stability and performance.
9. Performance Optimization: Analyzing response times and optimizing the backend for efficiency.
10. Error Handling and Edge Case Testing: Implementing robust error handling mechanisms and testing for edge cases.
11. Production Deployment Readiness: Finalizing the application for production, including security enhancements and scalability considerations.
12. Frontend State Management: Ensuring proper state management on the frontend to sync with backend operations.
