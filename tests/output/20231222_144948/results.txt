  "For a summer beach party, opt for a breezy and chic look. Consider a lightweight, brightly colored or patterned maxi dress that catches the sea breeze \u2013 perfect for comfort and style. Pair it with slip-on sandals, a wide-brimmed straw hat, and a tote bag to carry your beach essentials. Accessorize with a pair of sunglasses and some minimalistic, water-resistant jewelry to complete your sun-kissed ensemble."

  "Based on the search criteria provided and the product descriptions located within the knowledge base, I am unable to find any matches for a wide-brimmed straw hat, tote bag, sunglasses, minimalistic, water-resistant jewelry. It appears our current inventory does not include these specific items. Therefore, I will proceed with providing a structured JSON object indicating an empty product list using the `format_empty_wardrobe_response` function."
